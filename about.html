<p text-align: center>We have decided to name our project Foodo! A nifty recipe finder to make use out of the leftovers in your fridge.
We came up with a simple yet chic logo to fit with our project: Our website begins with the homepage, where at the top-left we have our logo, which also acts as a home button. Click it while you are on any of the other pages, and you will be brought back home. On the top navigation bar, we also have a Login and a Search Bar where you will be able to look for any recipes or ingredients by name. 
Along with these, you can check out the About page, which contains a brief introduction to the intended functionality of our website as well as for instructions as to how to use it.
The users can also suggest a recipe or ingredient to be added to the database, using the “Suggest” and “Ingredient/Recipe” button which can also be found there.
In the main section, we have all the different types of ingredients, which have all the entities listed and the user can just tick the box next to the ingredient they would like the recipes to contain.
On the left side is the recipes box, where the user can see all the recipes available with the ingredients ticked. The recipes can also be filtered by a bunch of criteria, such as “cuisine type”, “dietary restrictions”, and so on.
In the end, we have a footer that contains two buttons, “Contact”, and “Imprint”. The Imprint has been implemented according to the directions given in the homework.</p>
